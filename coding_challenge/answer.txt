Key things I would consider when creating/consuming an API :

1. Authentication and Authorization :- Only the required users are accssing your API securly.

2. Error Handling :- Design API to provide helpful error messages in case of exception.

3. Usage Limit :- Set limits on how often a user or system can make requests to your API.

4. Valid Input :- Check information you get from API so that it won't cause issues in your application.

6. Rate Limit :- Respect the maximum number of requests allowed with API otherwise you will be blocked.

6. Secure Data Transmission :- API communication should secured by using HTTPS.
