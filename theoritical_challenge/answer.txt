Tackling the Challenge:

File Reading: Use MultipartFile's input stream with CSVReader and ByteArrayOutputStream.
Data Processing: Evaluate formulas and update cell values dynamically.
Output Generation: Write processed CSV to ByteArrayOutputStream.
Error Handling:

Error Handling:

File Errors: Validate file type and handle read issues.
Parsing Errors: Manage invalid formulas and cell references.
Calculation Errors: Prevent division by zero and handle format issues.
Output Errors: Handle CSV writing exceptions.
Potential Issues & Mitigations:

Potential Issues & Mitigations:

Invalid File Types: Validate file extension and MIME type.
Malformed CSV Data: Check for parsing errors and data consistency.
Complex Formulas: Limit formula complexity and provide error messages.
Large Files: Set file size limits and optimize processing.
Invalid Cell References: Ensure all references are valid before evaluation.
Security Concerns: Validate and sanitize file uploads.
